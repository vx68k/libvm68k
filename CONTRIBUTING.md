# Pull request guidelines

## File encoding

Unless mandated by the media type, a file SHOULD be encoded either in `UTF-8`
(preferred) or in `US-ASCII`, and if it would be in `UTF-8`, it MUST NOT
contain any BOM (U+FEFF).

## End-of-line convention

Unless mandated by the media type, each line of a file SHOULD end with a single
LF (U+000A).
